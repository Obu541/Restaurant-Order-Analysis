# Restaurant-Order-Analysis
This project explores and analyzes order data of **Taste of the World Cafe** focusing on customer purchases of the restaurant's new menu items between January and March 2023.   
The goal of this project is to identify which menu items are doing well and which are not, as well as to analyze customer preferences and make recommendations for improving restaurant operations.  

üöÄ **Project Overview**
- The original dataset consists of **two tables**:
1. **`menu_items`**: Contains information about the menu, including item names, categories, and prices.
2. **`order_details`**: Contains data on customer orders, linking order IDs to menu items, and recording order dates and times.
Together, these tables allow for a comprehensive analysis of menu performance and customer behavior.
- This project is part of a guided course from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/). The dataset and project structure were provided, but all **data preparation, analysis, and visualization were completed by me**.

## üìö Project Objectives:
- Understand Menu Composition & Pricing: Identify the number of dishes, their price range, and distribution across categories.
- Analyze Customer Order Behavior: Track total orders, order frequency, and item popularity.
- Identify Revenue Drivers: Determine high-value orders and top-spending customers

## üçΩÔ∏è Menu Analysis
### 1. Explore the `menu_items` table
This includes details like item names, categories, and prices.  
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM menu_items;
   ```

### 2. Understanding the number of items  
   Number of items on the menu ‚Äì 32
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM menu_items;
   ```

###  3. Identify the least and most expensive items
   Least expensive: Edamame(Asian) - $5.00  
   Most expensive: Shrimp Scampi(Italian) - $19.95
```sql
SELECT * FROM menu_items ORDER BY price;
SELECT * FROM menu_items ORDER BY price DESC;
```
<img src="Images/1_3_1.png" width="400" />
<img src="Images/1_3_2.png" width="400" />

### 4. Identify the number of Italian dishes on the menu
   Number of Italian dishes on the menu - 9
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM menu_items WHERE category = "Italian";
```
<img src="Images/1_4.png" width="100" />

### 5. Identify the least and most expensive Italian dishes  
   Least expensive: Spaghetti - $14.50  
   Most expensive: Shrimp Scampi - $19.95
```sql
SELECT * FROM menu_items WHERE category = "Italian" ORDER BY price;
SELECT * FROM menu_items WHERE category = "Italian" ORDER BY price DESC;
```
<img src="Images/1_5_1.png" width="400" />
<img src="Images/1_5_2.png" width="400" />

### 6. Count the number of dishes and the average price in each category
   
   ```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(menu_item_id) AS num_dishes, AVG(price) AS avg_price  
FROM menu_items GROUP BY category;
```

## üõí Order Analisys
### 1. Explore the `order_details` table
This includes details such as order IDs, item IDs, order dates, and order times.
```sql
SELECT * FROM order_details;
```
<img src="Images/order_details_table.png" width="400" />

### 2. Finding the date range of the table
The earliest and latest dates within the order_details table - 
```sql
SELECT MIN(order_date), MAX(order_date) FROM order_details;
```

## üî• Key Insights:
- All locations show a strong positive growth trend, suggesting increasing customer demand over time.  
- Weekdays are consistently busy across all locations, especially in the morning hours between 7am and 10am,
indicating a likely demand for breakfast items, coffee, and quick service.
- However, the evening hours after 6 pm in Lower Manhattan and after 7 pm in Hell's Kithcen show very low transactions.   
- Coffee is the primary driver of sales across all locations, with tea and bakery items contributing to a smaller extent.

## üí° What recomendations can be offered:
- Since the evening hours are not busy, the store may lose money by staying open after 6 pm. It‚Äôs worth considering adjusting the store‚Äôs operating hours.  
- Offering discounts and promotions to customers in slow hours could encourage more people to visit when the store isn‚Äôt already overwhelmed.   
- Promoting items like breakfast sandwiches or pastries alongside coffee during peak hours could increase the average transaction value.
