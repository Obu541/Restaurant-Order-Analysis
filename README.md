# Restaurant-Order-Analysis
This project explores and analyzes order data of **Taste of the World Cafe** focusing on customer purchases of the restaurant's new menu items between January and March 2023.   
The goal of this project is to identify which menu items are doing well and which are not, as well as to analyze customer preferences and make recommendations for improving restaurant operations.  

üöÄ **Project Overview**
- The original dataset consists of **two tables**:
1. **`menu_items`**: Contains information about the menu, including item names, categories, and prices.
2. **`order_details`**: Contains data on customer orders, linking order IDs to menu items, and recording order dates and times.
Together, these tables allow for a comprehensive analysis of menu performance and customer behavior.
- This project is part of a guided course from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/). The dataset and project structure were provided, but all **data preparation, analysis, and visualization were completed by me**.

## üìö Project Objectives:
- Understand Menu Composition & Pricing: Identify the number of dishes, their price range, and distribution across categories.
- Analyze Customer Order Behavior: Track total orders, order frequency, and item popularity.
- Identify Revenue Drivers: Determine high-value orders and top-spending customers

## üíª  Technology Used:

## üíµCustomer Preferences & Spending Trends
### 1. Combining the `menu_items` and `order_details` tables
This step allows to get a comprehensive view of orders along with their respective details, such as item names and prices.
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id;
```
<img src="Images/3_1.png" width="500" />

### 2. Identifying the top 5 least and most Ordered Items, their Categories and Prices
The top 5 least ordered item are mostly Mexican     
The top 5 most ordered items are mostly American and Asian
```sql
SELECT item_name, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_purchases
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name
Order by num_purchases
Limit 5;
```
<img src="Images/3_2_1.png" width="500" />

```sql
SELECT item_name, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_purchases
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name
Order by num_purchases DESC
Limit 5;
``` 
<img src="Images/3_2_2.png" width="500" />

```sql
SELECT order_id, SUM(price) AS total_spend 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
<img src="Images/3_3.png" width="200" />

### 4. Viewing the details of the highest order
The Italian food ordered the most in the highest order 440, the most popular are 
two dishes: Spaghetti&Meatballs and Fettuccine Alredo.   
```sql
SELECT category, item_name, price, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id = 440
GROUP BY category, item_name, price
ORDER BY num_items DESC;
```
<img src="Images/3_4.png" width="400" />

### 5. Viewing the details of the Top 5 Highest Spent Orders
As the top 5 of the highest orders was identifyed earlier, in this step it is important look on them more in detail.
```sql
SELECT order_id, category, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id IN (440, 2075, 1957, 330, 2675)
GROUP BY order_id, category;
```
