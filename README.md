# Restaurant-Order-Analysis
This project explores and analyzes order data of **Taste of the World Cafe** focusing on customer purchases of the restaurant's new menu items between January and March 2023.   
The goal of this project is to identify which menu items are doing well and which are not, as well as to analyze customer preferences and make recommendations for improving restaurant operations.  

üöÄ **Project Overview**
- The original dataset consists of **two tables**:
1. **`menu_items`**: Contains information about the menu, including item names, categories, and prices.
2. **`order_details`**: Contains data on customer orders, linking order IDs to menu items, and recording order dates and times.
Together, these tables allow for a comprehensive analysis of menu performance and customer behavior.
- This project is part of a guided course from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/). The dataset and project structure were provided, but all **data preparation, analysis, and visualization were completed by me**.

## üìö Project Objectives:
- Understand Menu Composition & Pricing: Identify the number of dishes, their price range, and distribution across categories.
- Analyze Customer Order Behavior: Track total orders, order frequency, and item popularity.
- Identify Revenue Drivers: Determine high-value orders and top-spending customers

## üíª  Technology Used:

Number of orders - 5370
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
(SELECT order_id, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items 
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING num_items > 12) AS num_orders;
```
<img src="Images/2_3.png" width="200" />

### 4. Counting the total number of items ordered

SELECT order_id, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items 
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY num_items DESC;
```

### 6. Finding number of orders with more than 12 items
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
(SELECT order_id, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items 
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING num_items > 12) AS num_orders;
```

## üíµCustomer Preferences & Spending Trends
### 1. Combining the `menu_items` and `order_details` tables
This step allows to get a comprehensive view of orders along with their respective details, such as item names and prices.
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id;
```
<img src="Images/3_1.png" width="500" />

### 2. Identifying the top 5 least and most Ordered Items, their Categories and Prices
The top 5 least ordered item are **Chicken Tacos** (Mexican),    
The top 5 most ordered items are  **Humburger**(American),
```sql
SELECT item_name, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_purchases
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name
Order by num_purchases
Limit 5;
```
<img src="Images/3_2_1.png" width="500" />

```sql
SELECT item_name, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_purchases
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name
Order by num_purchases DESC
Limit 5;
``` 
<img src="Images/3_2_2.png" width="500" />

### 3. Identifying the Top 5 the most expensive Orders
The top 5 of the most expensive orders run between $185.10 AND $192.15 
```sql
SELECT order_id, SUM(price) AS total_spend 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
<img src="Images/3_3.png" width="200" />

### 4. Viewing the details of the highest order
The Italian food ordered the most in the highest order 440, the most popular are 
two dishes: Spaghetti&Meatballs and Fettuccine Alredo.   
```sql
SELECT category, item_name, price, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id = 440
GROUP BY category, item_name, price
ORDER BY num_items DESC;
```
<img src="Images/3_4.png" width="400" />

### 5. Viewing the details of the Top 5 Highest Spent Orders
As the top 5 of the highest orders was identifyed earlier, in this step it is important look on them more in detail.
```sql
SELECT order_id, category, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id IN (440, 2075, 1957, 330, 2675)
GROUP BY order_id, category;
```

## üí° What recomendations can be offered:
- Since the evening hours are not busy, the store may lose money by staying open after 6 pm. It‚Äôs worth considering adjusting the store‚Äôs operating hours.  
- Offering discounts and promotions to customers in slow hours could encourage more people to visit when the store isn‚Äôt already overwhelmed.   
- Promoting items like breakfast sandwiches or pastries alongside coffee during peak hours could increase the average transaction value.
